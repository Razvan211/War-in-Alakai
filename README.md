# War in Alakai Scope
War in Alakai is a fast-paced RTS in which a player will have to face a trained ML AGENT in a fight to victory. The player and the enemy will both start with one main building spawned in a designated area. The player and the AI have to wait for the needed resources to be produced and start building different buildings which will have roles like generating other resources, spawning units, and defence purposes. Killing enemy units and buildings will give a reward that consists of gold, lumber, or both depending on the type of unit or building destroyed. 

# What is War in Alakai
## War in Alakai is a project divided into two applications, one application handles real-time strategy mechanics, and the other application acts as a training environment for Machine Learning. The second application can be found in the ML-Agents Branch. At the moment, this project serves as research into machine integration in a real-time strategy environment.

## The characters and structures are based on what the project aimed to be. At the moment they do not comply with all of the functionalities.
# Characters:
## Warrior:
The warrior is the main melee unit which can be used to tank the incoming damage. The warrior will have the most health, more damage than the mage, and a slower attack speed.
## Mage: 
The mage is the main ranged unit which will have the purpose of inflicting substantial damage to the enemy units and basic buildings.
## Catapult:
The catapult is the most important unit. It will have a long-range and it is the only unit that can win the game. The catapult will be more expensive than any other unit, it will have a substantial amount of damage, and it will move at a slower pace. You can spawn only one at a time.

# Structures:
## Castle:
it is spawned at the beginning and determines the base of the player/AI. Produces gold, and once upgraded it makes the building radius around it bigger so a player/ai can build something at a bigger distance from the base (generates 5 gold/ second).
## Lumber mill:
Cost: 350 gold. It generates lumber, and it can spawn Warriors (generates 10 lumber/second).
## Mage Tower:
Cost: 500 gold and 150 wood. The mage tower is a defensive structure, and it can spawn mages.
## Workshop:
Cost: 1000 gold and 500 wood. It spawns catapults (strong characters in the game).

## Structures purpose:
- Economical - producing resources to build other buildings and spawn units.
- Spawning - each building will spawn a different type of unit.
- Win/Lose criteria - One main building will be spawned at the beginning of the game for each team, once the player will destroy the enemy building the game will be finished and the player will win, else if the player's main building will be destroyed the enemy will win.

# OS:
## Windows

#Project Management:
## Notion

# Engine:
## Unity 2021.3.11.f1 was the engine of choice as the developer of the game has experience in using it and it provides the necessary means for the development of the game.

# Assets:
## Blender 2.82 was the version of choice as this is the software in which the developer has worked the most.
